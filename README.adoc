= Analyze Jenkins Plugins

Helps with analyzing Jenkins plugins.
This was motivated by the log4j2 vulnerability and the scramble to fix plugins that were unmaintained.

== Usage

Run this command

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew run
----

It will download the update-center.json from the Jenkins server and analyze the plugins listed there.
Right now the analysis involves the identifying all the jars in the plugin.
It generates a report at `$HOME/jenkins-plugins/plugin-jars.csv` that you can use any tool to then further analyze. Example https://gist.github.com/rahulsom/4f992c5c16afc91ee4113ec5da61c21b[here].

I have used http://harelba.github.io/q/[q] to run SQL queries on the report.
